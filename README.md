# Mapping Deprived Areas
The aim of this project is to effectively map out deprived areas using machine learning model.

# 10m by 10m
The results from 10m by 10m samples were very discouraging and so resampling carried out to 100m grid.

# 100m by 100m 
Resampling was carried out on 10m by 10m datasets by GDAL geospatial package on python.
The results as you will explore are promising.
